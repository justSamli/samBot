# samBot
SamBot was a project carried out in class during my master programme. 


## Tools
IDE used was Code Composer Studion v8.
Micro-controller used was MSP430G2553 Launchpad
Programme was written in Embedded C language


## Brief Description
A mini robot was programmed using Embedded C
language so that it could detect and follow a white line on black background, avoid obstacles in front and on the right side
while moving at a convenient speed.
```
Key learning points: 
* to programme a microcontroller in Embedded C to perform a task
* to practice how to enable and disable I/O ports on microcontroller
* to practice programming PWM on motors running the robot
* to set sensors to read at a particular distance for object detection and light detection
```


## Acknowledgements
Although this was an individual project, the class came together to help each person complete their own. :)
